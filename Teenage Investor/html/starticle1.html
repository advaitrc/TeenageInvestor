  <p class="lead" style="font-family: 'pnb'">Unedited</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p style="font-family: 'pn'">Investing in the stock market is a skill which when mastered sets you on a path of true financial freedom. It doesn't matter whether you're in college, are working in an office or are still in school remember when it comes to the stock market the quicker you get involved and take advantage of the power of compound interest the better it is for you. One of the most ironic things about investing is the simplicity of the act itself but the massive confusion and doubt that surrounds it. As you will start learning more and more about this process you will begin to realize yourself how much of the presumed complexity is just because of some of the heavy jargon used to convey extremely simple things.<br><br>
Perhaps itâ€™s this reason, the lack of knowledge or simply the lack of courage that stops the middle-class families from truly harnessing the power and benefits of the markets but there is no doubt that this is a defining trend. Depending on how you approach investing and how much you invest, your returns may vary from  50 rupees to a substantial profit but just by being proactive, putting yourself on the path through for instance choosing to read this very blog you have put yourself on the path of the rich and broken away from a metal cycle. If you have chosen to invest in the stock market for whatever the reason maybe you have already subconsciously chosen to look for ways to maximize your net worth, acquire assets and not depend on your income solely. These are the paths Robert Kiyosaki describes as the differentiating financial decision between the rich and poor in one of the greatest personal finance books ever written; rich dad poor dad.<br><br>
The reasons to invest are wide-ranging, if done right you could make this a career path or at the very least truly make your money work for you by multiplying itself nevertheless here are some substantial reasons why investing in the stock market is beneficial.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">1) Fight global market events:</span> <br>
By investing in the stock market, you can combat the rise in the price of commodities or inflation and changes in monetary policies. As cited in the intelligent investor, it is during periods of crisis that true wealth is made in the stock markets.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">2) Create wealth:</span> <br>
Investing makes your money work for you and with the right knowledge at an early age you can save up enough money to be financially independent and buy large purchases like cars, homes etc<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">3)Retirement:</span><br> Depending on how old you when you started investing and how you went about it you can strive for early retirement or a comfortable one.
As a means of storing money for the long term by finding the right companies and value investing. Remember based on historical trends the stock markets on average compound nearly 10 % annually, this is better than the rates any bank could give you (You have to however be extremely cautious and certain about your decision if you should choose to go on this path.<br>
Remember when a long-term stock is on your account you are not taxed for it.<br><br>

<span style="font-family: pnb">4)Compound Interest:</span> <br>Lastly and perhaps most importantly investing helps you harness the power of compound interest describe by Einstein as the 8th wonder of the world.
Here's an example to illustrate why<br>
Ganesh and Sartaj are two people how decided to invest their money<br>
Sartaj began investing at 19 and invested 2000 rupees for 8 years whereas Sartaj did the same only he started at 27 and continued till 65, remember Ganesh didn't invest a rupee after he turned 27 while Sartaj invested for much longer, at age 65 here are the returns they got
if they picked a long-term fund with a 12 % ROI:<br><br>

Ganesh has 22 lakhs while Sartaj has only 15 lakhs<br>
This illustrates how important it is to start as early as you can with whatever you can, even if you are in school or college to witness the magic of compound interest.
