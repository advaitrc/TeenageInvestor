  <p class="lead" style="font-family: 'pnb'">Advait</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p style="font-family: 'pn'">In this article, we will explain the 19 basic stock market terms you need to know in 2019 before you get started with investing in the share market.<br><br>
With the knowledge of these basic stock market terms, you too will be able to start understanding and make sense of the stock market jargon you hear on the news to learn and improve the way you invest in the Indian Share Market. <br>
Here are the 19 basic stock market terms every beginner should know as they start out investing in the Indian share market:
<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">1)  Going Long:</span> <br> Going long essentially means to buy a stock with the confidence that its price will surely increase sometime in the future when you can sell it and make a profit. Here&rsquo;s an example: Let&rsquo;s say Ramesh goes long on 100 shares of Parle (Let us assume it is trading at 10 rupees), This means that Ramesh has bought the shares worth 1000 rupees. If 
the price of the shares rises to 12, making Ramesh a profit of 200 rupees.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">2)  Going Short: </span><br> This can be thought as the opposite of going long but there is a slight nuance that you must understand. When you short something you are convinced that the price of that commodity i.e the stock will go down, so when you short a share of reliance (which is trading at around 1348 rupees) you are essentially selling this share at this price. You may naturally wonder how the question of selling comes into place given the fact that you don&rsquo;t really own any share as such; this is where you need to understand that (other than in intraday trading) there is a window between buying a stock and the stock arriving in our depository. So when you sell a stock at a certain price (short it) you will have to buy that stock at some point in the future so that the trade follows through and the buyer actually gets the stock in his account. You are banking on the hope that when you buy the stock to close the trade at some point in the future after you have shorted the stock, that the value of the stock actually falls.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">3)  Bulls/Bullish:</span> <br> A bull attacks its prey with its horns, raising its head high. This is why this term is used to describe an uptrend, growth or positive outlook regarding a stock, a company or the entire market. The school of thought that believes that any low in the market is going to be accompanied with a high coming in the future is bullish. A bullish trader goes long on the stock he buys because he is positive that the price of the commodity is going to increase. Bulls could be called optimists in some sense. <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">4)  Bears/Bearish:</span> <br> A bear pounces down on its prey; its body movement is downward and hence this term is used to describe downtrends. Bears believe that the market/ a commodity is going to go down or sure. The way they make profits is by shorting stocks. When a commodity/ market is in a downtrend it is called bearish.
<br><br>
A general rule of thumb to remember is to buy when the stock is bullish ( rising) and sell when it is bearish (falling). The reason for this is that the trends show market sentiment and act as an indicator of how the markets will behave. <br><br> Remember the stocks of great companies with solid financials can also tank this just goes to show that the stock market is majorly governed by peoples, sentiments and hence their actions. <br><br> There is an entire school of thought on how to trade based on technical indicators that tell us how the market behaves called technical analysis. You can check out our article on technical analysis for more information.
<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">5)  Dividends:</span> <br> When companies generate a profit they broadly have 3 options with regard to how they use their profits. They may choose to reinvest the money, buy back their stock ( which we will discuss later) or issue dividends. <br> In issuing dividends they take their profit money and divide it among the shareholders based on the number of shares they hold. There are certain rules regarding the eligibility of dividends based on when they were announced etc which you must make yourself aware of before you go ahead and buy any stock. This article by Lauda may help. Companies may have many different motives when they issue dividends but generally, dividend stocks are older companies that have reached a saturation point when it comes to the technological advancement they can do so dividends are a great way to keep shareholders happy as well as entice others in the market. If you are a risk-averse trader it may make sense to choose these kinds of stocks. <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">6)Sector:</span><br>
A group of companies that represent a segment of the market.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">7)Market Capitalization:</span> The value of the company based on the price of its stock. <br> Market cap = Number of share  X  Value of a share <br>
Based on the size of their market cap (for short) companies can be classified into the small, mid and large-cap.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">8) Growth Stock: </span><br> The stock of a company that is projected to grow at an above-average level is a growth stock. These stocks are extremely popular and are traded extensively. Beyond Meat is a great example of a growth stock. If a new Indian company ( which Is relatively independent of external sources of investment and people gobbling up equity) lets say Oyo were to go public it could very well become a growth stock <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">9)Value Stock:</span> <br>The stock of a company that is known for producing steady profits is called a value stock. These are great companies with solid fundamentals and great leadership. They are safe long term investments. Reliance in present times is a great example of a value stock. Value investing ( of which Waren Buffet is a vocal advocate) is the principle of investing in Value Stock for the long term by identifying good companies with solid finances.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">10)Open, close,high,low:</span> <br>Open is the price at which the stock opened in the market. <br>
Close is the price at which the stock trades as the stock market closes at 3:30
Intraday high/low: This is the highest/ lowest price the stock traded during the course of the day.
<br>
These four terms are abbreviated as OHLC : Open high low and close. <br> Their values together give a rough overall picture of how the trading day went for the stock
<br> 52 week high/low is the highest or lowest price a stock hits in a year ( 52) <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">11)  Bid/ask :</span><br> Bid is what you are willing to pay for a stock and ask is what people are asking for a stock.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">12) Limit order:</span> <br>This is a type of trade in which the transaction gets executed only when the stock prize crosses a certain value set by you (under a purchase price or above a sales price)
For example. You want to buy a stock of reliance only when its price goes below 1200 rupees. You can choose to set a limit order for these parameters and the trade will get executed by itself the moment the price of the stock falls below 1200 . <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">13) Market order: </span><br>This is type of order executes the trade at whatever price the stock is trading at.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">14) Volatility:</span> <br>This is how fast a stock goes up or down. <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">15) Liquidity: </span><br>This is how easy it is to get in and out of trade ( Based on the numbers of buyers and sellers available and the volume of th stock being traded.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">16) Trading volume:</span> <br> This is the number of shares being bought and sold on a given day.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">17) ETFs:</span><br>Exchange Traded Funds are bought and traded lile stocks but are similar to mutual funds because they track indices.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">18) Rally:</span> <br>An above average increase in the price of a share or the market.<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">19) Ticker symbols:</span> <br>The symbol or abbreviated letter code under which a stock is traded. For example the ticker symbol for reliance is RIL.<br><br>
