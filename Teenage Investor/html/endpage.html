  <p style="font-family: 'pn'">Making Money without a college degree

Growing up in India, teenagers, children, even college students never think you can actually work and earn money before you have your degree in hand. The reality is, as technology progresses rapidly, college degrees are more outdated, not providing you with the skills that are in demand in the market.<br><br> 

Personally, I had learned some machine learning/AI coding with Python in 9th grade, just for fun. In 10th grade, I got an opportunity to work for a start up that needed a machine learning algorithm to be made and integrated into their product. Since there were hardly any people who could do what they wanted, I picked up the project, worked on it from home, and had it completed even before they could find anyone who would do it. After testing my solution, they were happy and paid me pretty well. Today that product is owned by Ernst & Young (EY), a large MNC and is used by various other companies.<br><br>

Here, I’ll teach you how you can do the same, in India, the problems you’ll face, how to overcome them, and how you can earn upwards of 15,000-20,000 rupees depending on the project, without needing a college degree, or being over 20 years old. Not only will this provide value in terms of money, but will also be a great addition to your college resume, if you’re still in school, or even for your work resume when applying for a job.<br><br>

Here are my 3 steps to get yourself up and working.<br><br>
<br>

<span style="font-family: pnb">1. Picking up and Learning an in-demand skill</span><br>
Being a student, or a dropout, you have time. Look for in-demand skills in the market online, or check out our own list here. Pick a skill you find interesting or enjoy, and learn it. Even if you don’t get paid for it, it will come in handy sometime. Don’t spend too much time picking one, be decisive and stick with it. Its important you get deep into whatever you’re learning, and learn from a good, reputed resource. While you have many options online, its best to go with a name you’ve heard before.
Only once you’re totally comfortable with whatever you’ve learned, know its ins and outs, should you move to the next step.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">2. Building your credibility</span><br>
No one’s gonna give you work if they don’t trust you or your skills. This means you should either personally know the person who’s gonna give you the work and pay you, or your skillset should be demonstrated effectively enough for someone to pick you up and pay you. Since most of us probably don’t have that first option, let’s see how we can accomplish the second. Now, while the exact methods vary by industry/the skill you’ve chosen, the general formula remains more or less the same.<br><br>
  <span style="font-family: pnb">A.</span> Answer questions online. Be it on Quora, or something more specific like Stack Overflow for coders, answer as many questions as you can, but make sure you have complete knowledge of what they’re asking before you go out doing so.<br>
  <span style="font-family: pnb">B.</span> Do a project or projects using everything you’ve learned. If you’re doing digital marketing, build an Instagram page, if its machine learning, build a unique classifier. This is something in which you put your knowledge to work, and on display.<br>
  <span style="font-family: pnb">C.</span> Work for someone for free. You can’t always get paid for the first job you do, without a reputation. Offer to do something an organization is looking for, for free. Not only will this add to your portfolio, but if the company wants to update the system in the future, they can contact you, and if you did a good job, they should pay you.<br>
  <span style="font-family: pnb">D.</span> Summate everything you’ve done in your resume.<br>
Remember, this an not an all inclusive list. Add and tweak it around for your industry, and do as much as you can.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">3. Find work</span><br>
Get onto freelancing websites, like Upwork, Freelancer, LocalShout etc., make a LinkedIn profile, look at Stack Overflow jobs, reply to posts, do whatever you think is good. Mention whatever you did as part of Step 2 in your profile and reach out to as many people as you can. If you’re confused about which website to use, check out out post on it here.<br>
<br>
I hope this post was helpful and encouraging enough for you to take action. Remember, even if you earn nothing, a learned skill is always useful, be it for your college resume, or finding other work.<br>
