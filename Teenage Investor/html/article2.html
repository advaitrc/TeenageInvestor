  <p class="lead" style="font-family: 'pnb'">By Jian Yang</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p style="font-family: 'pn'">Freelancing is a great way to make a quick buck and gain some work experience. We’ll be looking over the best freelancing websites to find some work and make some money for Indian students, not professionals, though a lot of the information will still apply to professionals as well.<br><br>

All of these websites will have ease of use, lots of opportunity, and be a good stepping stone to a project you pick up offline. Instead of just giving you a list of options, I’ll provide you specific options for you, personally.<br><br>

<span style="font-family: pnb">
For your First Time</span><br>
If you’re still a work virgin, you might wanna start out with Fiverr. It lets you do a small job of your interest for $5-$10. Its easy to get work even without experience here and there’s postings for any kind of work you can think of. The best way forward would be to do 3-4 jobs on Fiverr, essentially building a portfolio which you can then use to provide credibility on slightly more professional websites. Fiverr is a really powerful tool though, and you can earn money for a lot of non-conventional work. Read our article on how to use Fiverr well for more on that.<br><br>
<img src="fiv.jpg" class="photo"><br><br>So now you have a decent portfolio and you’ve made enough to buy a pizza for yourself. Now its time to move on to slightly more high paying and professional portals. To be clear, most of these still aren’t the best for a full time freelancer, but suits students and dropouts well<br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb" class="photo">For Designers</span><br>
For designers specifically (graphic, web, anything design-related really) I’d recommend either 99Designs or DesignHill. It offers good work and has a great system to get you the work, kinda like a contest. For every posting, anyone can send in their designs and if the company offering the work like your design, you get the work. So you have to have good skills to get regular work on this, but if you’re decent at it, its a great place to get work and make some money, especially as a student. Its a well designed website and one of my personal favorites.<br><br>
<img src="diz.png" class="photo"><br><br><span style="font-family: pnb">For Programmers</span><br>
This is a tough one, as it may require a longer process to get some decent work as a programmer, not working in web dev or front end, that is. While all big freelancing websites have tabs for programmers, its hard to get those jobs as a student just starting out. One recommendation is Hubstaff Talent. While there’s less work to be found as its still a new website, it has an easy sign up process, and anyone can find work. Maybe as this article ages that becomes a better recommendation and scarcity of work decreases, but unfortunately for now you’ll just have to live with that and your general freelance marketplaces. If you’re active on Stack Overflow, and somehow manage to get a Stack Career account, which is invite only, Stack Overflow Jobs is a good place to find high payying, interesting work for you.<br>
<img src="epicode.png" class="photo"><br><br><span style="font-family: pnb">
For animation and video editing</span><br>
Envato Studio would be my pick for this category. Its in the name itself really. Though Envato is a general freelance marketplace its better than its competitors in these fields. There’s no advantage here for students or beginners so you’ll have to work to get that first project. Its a good idea to sign up on other general marketplaces too.<br><br>
<img src="stud.png" class="photo"><br><br><span style="font-family: pnb">
For everyone else</span><br>
Here you have a lot of options, and it may be your best bet to use them all. Upwork is the best one in my eyes, followed closely by Freelancer. An Indian alternative is Truelancer, though I have no experience with that personally<br><br>
That wraps up my list for the best freelancing portals for Indian students and beginners in freelancing. If you wanna learn on how to better use these portals as a tool along with other things to make money on the side, check out our post about it here.
