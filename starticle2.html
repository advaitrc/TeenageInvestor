  <h1 class="display-4" style="font-family: spoty ; font-weight: ">An Introduction to the Stock Markets</h1>
  <p class="lead" style="font-family: 'pnb'">Unedited</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p style="font-family: 'pn'">Basically, stocks or shares can be thought of like parts or pieces of companies that you own. Think of the way kids are taught fractions using the slices of a pizza only that the slices are shares of a company and by virtue of owning them you become part owners of the companies essentially. Many people just like you are buying and selling many slices of a hypothetical extremely large pie of pizza and there many pies of pizzas of different flavours. Now imagine a large market place where people buying selling and trading these slices in possible combinations. This market place is essentially what the stock market, literally a market place for the trade of stocks. If many people want a particular kind of pizza this drives up the price of that pizza and if many people don’t want a pizza and start selling the slices this drives down the value of the pizza.<br><br>
Now that you have a general sense of what the stock market is like let’s hold on to this idea and work ahead with it. In this article we will be explaining the various parts of the stock market; the various parts of the machine that keep it running. <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">Market Participants: </span><br>Market participants are as the name suggests the buyers and sellers in any market place, in this case, the market is the stock market or the share market. Imagine the pizza marketplace the companies are sellers and you are the buyers but it may also happen that some companies themselves choose to buy back their slices or shares or a large corporation chooses to buy a large number of shares but we will come to this sometime later. <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">SEBI:</span> <br> This is the securities and exchanges bureau of India. They are responsible for making sure no malpractices occur in the stock market. They make sure that trading takes place fairly and smoothly and large corporations don’t abuse their power. One of their jobs is making sure Insider trading doesn’t take place. Imagine you know someone who knew for sure that the price of a certain Pizza was going to go down because perhaps he/she worked at that pizzeria then by virtue of the knowledge you have  you have an advantage over  other participants in the marketplace and so you quickly start selling that pizza and make a great profit whereas others make a loss this is a perfect example of insider trading where  you use inside knowledge of a company to make a profit. This is a serious offence with serious consequences. <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">Depository:</span> <br> a depository is like a bank account for your stocks it is important to note that bank accounts are not where your stock is stored. Imagine a depository as the physical place where the stocks and shares you buy are kept. In the example of the pizzas think of the depository as a bag where you store all your slices. The depository account is popularly called the DEMAT account. You will, however, link this account to your bank account so that transactions take place smoothly. <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">Stockbroker:</span> <br>
a stockbroker is someone who trades stocks the thing is, not everyone can trade stocks themselves you require a licence to do so and this is what a stockbroker does now for you personally as someone who wants to get into the market you may choose to hire a stockbroker and financial advisor or you may choose to trade yourself using a trading terminal in exchange of brokerage fees.<br><br>
A stockbroker is a licensed individual or a service you choose that has the power to actually perform the transaction of buying or selling a stock or shares. Not everyone can buy or sell a stock if they wish to, so when you want to buy or sell a stock you will have to choose a brokerage service like edelweiss to actually perform the task for you in exchange of brokerage fees. We highly recommend using Zerodha; an app-based interface that allows you to virtually trade by yourself with very nominal brokerage fees and a very easy interface to use. <br><br> 
<span style="font-family: pnb">Clearing Corporation: </span><br>
Clearing corporation can be thought of as another safety check similar to the SEBI like the SEBI clearing corporations make sure that when you trade stocks shares are transferred to your account and no one cheats you. NSCCL (National securities clearing corporation) and the Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL) is responsible for executing this function in the Indian ecosystem. <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">Stock Exchange:</span> <br> This is a facility where traders and stockbrokers can buy and sell a stock. They act like markets where buyers can connect with sellers. The two major stock exchanges in India are the BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange) and the NSE (National Stock Exchange). We will cover this in future articles. <br><br>
<span style="font-family: pnb">Index: </span><br>An index can be thought of as a collective unit representing a certain number of companies from certain stock exchanges, they may also be sector-specific like for the tech industry etc. Indices serve to give a macro overview of a particular industry/stock exchange country as a whole. An index is like the average marks of your class for a particular exam which gives a rough estimate of that state of matters for the whole class as compared to the marks of a single student. <br><br>
These are some absolute basic terms you should know as a prerequisite to any course of study in the stock market.  Don’t worry we will continue to explain any new concepts as and when they co
